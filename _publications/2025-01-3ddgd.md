3D face technology offers stronger security than 2D methods in biometric authentication. This study enhances 3D facial systems against deepfakes by demonstrating the superiority of 3D over 2D, creating a real/fake 3D face dataset, and developing deepfake detection models using MLP, self-attention, and TabTransformer. Results show that 3D face meshes significantly improve deepfake detection robustness.
