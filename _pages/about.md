I am a PhD Student at the **Echizen Laboratory**, **National Institute of Informatics (NII)**, SOKENDAI, Tokyo, Japan. 

My research lies at the intersection of **3D computer vision**, **biometric security**, and **multimodal large vision-language models (LVLMs)**. I focus on developing **privacy-preserving 3D face recognition systems** that remain robust against deepfake and reconstruction attacks.

## Research Interests

- 3D Computer Vision
- Biometric Security and Authentication
- Multimodal Vision Language Models
- Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
- Deepfake Detection and Generation
- Federated Learning
- 3D Face Recognition
