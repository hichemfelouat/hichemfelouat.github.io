I am a PhD Student at the Echizen Laboratory, National Institute of Informatics (NII), SOKENDAI. My research lies at the intersection of 3D computer vision, biometric security, and multimodal large vision-language models (LVLMs). I focus on developing privacy-preserving 3D face recognition systems that remain robust against deepfake and reconstruction attacks.
