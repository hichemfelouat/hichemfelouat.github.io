I am a PhD Student at the **Echizen Laboratory**. 
**National Institute of Informatics (NII)**.
**Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI**.
Tokyo, Japan. 

My research lies at the intersection of **3D computer vision**, **biometric security**, and **multimodal large vision-language models (LVLMs)**. I focus on developing **privacy-preserving 3D face recognition systems** that remain robust against deepfake and reconstruction attacks.
